-- HOW THE COLORS WORK --

glow = type color
for each stat adjusted a color is added to a gradient.

example 1
stats: speed
type: common
colors: object = yellow, glow = null

example 2
stats: damage, bullet
type: uncommon
colors: object = gradient(red, orange), glow = gray

example 3
stats: damage, bullet, speed, health
type: god
colors: object = gradient(red, orange, yellow, green), glow = purple
